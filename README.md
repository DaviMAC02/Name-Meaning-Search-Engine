# Name-Meaning-Search-Engine
Personal project developed with no commercial purpose, uses web scraping algorithms made in python to retrieve, process and vizualize data. Skills used: Python language in general, urllib, Beaultiful Soup (BS4), SQLite, JSON, HTML, CSS, JS, Responsive Design.

Note: Unfortunately some crucial files of this project have been lost, they were responsible for accessing the website with the name meanings, collecting the names
meaning and finally saving more links of the same website in order to find more names, I intend to recode all these files soon, in the meantime, you can play with
the names that had already been scrapped and added to a .JSON file, thanks.
