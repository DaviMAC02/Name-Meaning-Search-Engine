# Name-Meaning-Search-Engine
Personal project developed with no commercial purpose, uses web scraping algorithms made in python to retrieve, process and vizualize data. Skills used: Python language in general, urllib, Beaultiful Soup (BS4), SQLite, JSON, HTML, CSS, JS, Responsive Design.

Note: Unfortunately a crucial file of this project has been lost, it was responsible for scrapping links from the same website in a loop so I could search name meaning from uncountable pages, I intend to recode it soon, in the meantime, you can play with the names that have already been scrapped and saved in a .json file, thanks.
